# WeatherAnomalyIsolationForest

## Aim
Implementation of Anomaly Detection in weather data using unsupervised Isolation Forest over a timeline.

## Description
Isolation forest is a machine learning algorithm for anomaly detection. It is an unsupervised learning algorithm that identifies anomaly by isolating outliers in the data.
This concept is used to find anomalies in the weather data over a time period. Given below are some images of the anomalies detected.

A clear explanation of the mathematics behind this concept is given in the report.

## Results
The below table gives the results of Isolation forest for the New York city weather data.
